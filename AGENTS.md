# AGENTS.md

- Repo layout: frontend lives in `src/`, Tauri backend lives in `src-tauri/`.
- If you are editing frontend or backend code, read the nested AGENTS in that folder.
- Frontend workflows use npm scripts from `package.json` (Vite/Storybook).
- Backend workflows use Cargo within `src-tauri/`.
