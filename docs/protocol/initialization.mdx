title: "Initialization"
description: "How all Agent Client Protocol connections begin"
---

{/* todo! link to all concepts */}

The Initialization phase allows [Clients](./overview#client) and [Agents](./overview#agent) to negotiate protocol versions, capabilities, and authentication methods.

<br />

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant Agent

    Note over Client, Agent: Connection established
    Client->>Agent: initialize
    Note right of Agent: Negotiate protocol<br/>version & capabilities
    Agent-->>Client: initialize response
    Note over Client,Agent: Ready for session setup
```

<br />

Before a Session can be created, Clients **MUST** initialize the connection by calling the `initialize` method with:

- The latest [protocol version](#protocol-version) supported
- The [capabilities](#client-capabilities) supported

They **SHOULD** also provide a name and version to the Agent.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 0,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": 1,
    "clientCapabilities": {
      "fs": {
        "readTextFile": true,
        "writeTextFile": true
      },
      "terminal": true
    },
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "my-client",
      "title": "My Client",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

The Agent **MUST** respond with the chosen [protocol version](#protocol-version) and the [capabilities](#agent-capabilities) it supports. It **SHOULD** also provide a name and version to the Client as well:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 0,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": 1,
    "agentCapabilities": {
      "loadSession": true,
      "promptCapabilities": {
        "image": true,
        "audio": true,
        "embeddedContext": true
      },
      "mcp": {
        "http": true,
        "sse": true
      }
    },
    "agentInfo": {
      "name": "my-agent",
      "title": "My Agent",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "authMethods": []
  }
}
```

## Protocol version

The protocol versions that appear in the `initialize` requests and responses are a single integer that identifies a **MAJOR** protocol version. This version is only incremented when breaking changes are introduced.

Clients and Agents **MUST** agree on a protocol version and act according to its specification.

See [Capabilities](#capabilities) to learn how non-breaking features are introduced.

### Version Negotiation

The `initialize` request **MUST** include the latest protocol version the Client supports.

If the Agent supports the requested version, it **MUST** respond with the same version. Otherwise, the Agent **MUST** respond with the latest version it supports.

If the Client does not support the version specified by the Agent in the `initialize` response, the Client **SHOULD** close the connection and inform the user about it.

## Capabilities

Capabilities describe features supported by the Client and the Agent.

All capabilities included in the `initialize` request are **OPTIONAL**. Clients and Agents **SHOULD** support all possible combinations of their peer's capabilities.

The introduction of new capabilities is not considered a breaking change. Therefore, Clients and Agents **MUST** treat all capabilities omitted in the `initialize` request as **UNSUPPORTED**.

Capabilities are high-level and are not attached to a specific base protocol concept.

Capabilities may specify the availability of protocol methods, notifications, or a subset of their parameters. They may also signal behaviors of the Agent or Client implementation.

Implementations can also [advertise custom capabilities](./extensibility#advertising-custom-capabilities) using the `_meta` field to indicate support for protocol extensions.

### Client Capabilities

The Client **SHOULD** specify whether it supports the following capabilities:

#### File System

<ParamField path="readTextFile" type="boolean">
  The `fs/read_text_file` method is available.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="writeTextFile" type="boolean">
  The `fs/write_text_file` method is available.
</ParamField>

<Card icon="file" horizontal href="./file-system">

</Card>

#### Terminal

<ParamField path="terminal" type="boolean">
  All `terminal/*` methods are available, allowing the Agent to execute and
  manage shell commands.
</ParamField>

<Card icon="terminal" horizontal href="./terminals">
  Learn more about Terminals
</Card>

### Agent Capabilities

The Agent **SHOULD** specify whether it supports the following capabilities:

<ResponseField name="loadSession" type="boolean" post={["default: false"]}>
  The [`session/load`](./session-setup#loading-sessions) method is available.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="promptCapabilities" type="PromptCapabilities Object">
  Object indicating the different types of [content](./content) that may be
  included in `session/prompt` requests.
</ResponseField>

#### Prompt capabilities

As a baseline, all Agents **MUST** support `ContentBlock::Text` and `ContentBlock::ResourceLink` in `session/prompt` requests.

Optionally, they **MAY** support richer types of [content](./content) by specifying the following capabilities:

<ResponseField name="image" type="boolean" post={["default: false"]}>
  The prompt may include `ContentBlock::Image`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="audio" type="boolean" post={["default: false"]}>
  The prompt may include `ContentBlock::Audio`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="embeddedContext" type="boolean" post={["default: false"]}>
  The prompt may include `ContentBlock::Resource`
</ResponseField>

#### MCP capabilities

<ResponseField name="http" type="boolean" post={["default: false"]}>
  The Agent supports connecting to MCP servers over HTTP.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sse" type="boolean" post={["default: false"]}>
  The Agent supports connecting to MCP servers over SSE.

Note: This transport has been deprecated by the MCP spec.

</ResponseField>

#### Session Capabilities

As a baseline, all Agents **MUST** support `session/new`, `session/prompt`, `session/cancel`, and `session/update`.

Optionally, they **MAY** support other session methods and notifications by specifying additional capabilities.

<Note>
  `session/load` is still handled by the top-level `load_session` capability.
  This will be unified in future versions of the protocol.
</Note>

## Implementation Information

Both Clients and Agents **SHOULD** provide information about their implementation in the `clientInfo` and `agentInfo` fields respectively. Both take the following three fields:

<ParamField path="name" type="string">
  Intended for programmatic or logical use, but can be used as a display name
  fallback if title isn’t present.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="title" type="string">
  Intended for UI and end-user contexts — optimized to be human-readable and
  easily understood. If not provided, the name should be used for display.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="version" type="string">
  Version of the implementation. Can be displayed to the user or used for
  debugging or metrics purposes.
</ParamField>

<Info>
  Note: in future versions of the protocol, this information will be required.
</Info>

Once the connection is initialized, you're ready to [create a session](./session-setup) and begin the conversation with the Agent.
