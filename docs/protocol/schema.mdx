## Agent

Defines the interface that all ACP-compliant agents must implement.

Agents are programs that use generative AI to autonomously modify code. They handle
requests from clients and execute tasks using language models and tools.

### <span class="font-mono">authenticate</span>

Authenticates the client using the specified authentication method.

Called when the agent requires authentication before allowing session creation.
The client provides the authentication method ID that was advertised during initialization.

After successful authentication, the client can proceed to create sessions with
`new_session` without receiving an `auth_required` error.

See protocol docs: [Initialization](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/initialization)

#### <span class="font-mono">AuthenticateRequest</span>

Request parameters for the authenticate method.

Specifies which authentication method to use.

**Type:** Object

**Properties:**

<ResponseField name="_meta" type={"object | null"} >
  The _meta property is reserved by ACP to allow clients and agents to attach additional
metadata to their interactions. Implementations MUST NOT make assumptions about values at
these keys.

See protocol docs: [Extensibility](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/extensibility)

</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="methodId" type={"string"} required>

</ResponseField>

### <span class="font-mono">initialize</span>

Establishes the connection with a client and negotiates protocol capabilities.

This method is called once at the beginning of the connection to:

- Negotiate the protocol version to use
- Exchange capability information between client and agent

that affect system prompts, tool availability, and permission behaviors.

The mode must be one of the modes advertised in `availableModes` during session
creation or loading. Agents may also change modes autonomously and notify the
client via `current_mode_update` notifications.

This method can be called at any time during a session, whether the Agent is
idle or actively generating a response.

</ResponseField>

<a id="terminal-release"></a>
### <span class="font-mono">terminal/release</span>

Releases a terminal

The command is killed if it hasn't exited yet. Use `terminal/wait_for_exit`
to wait for the command to exit before releasing the terminal.

After release, the `TerminalId` can no longer be used with other `terminal/*` methods,
but tool calls that already contain it, continue to display its output.

The `terminal/kill` method can be used to terminate the command without releasing
the terminal, allowing the Agent to call `terminal/output` and other methods.

- Language model output streamed through `session/update` notifications
- Progress updates and results from tool calls

This structure is compatible with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling
agents to seamlessly forward content from MCP tool outputs without transformation.

## <span class="font-mono">RequestId</span>

JSON RPC Request Id

An identifier established by the Client that MUST contain a String, Number, or NULL value if included. If it is not included it is assumed to be a notification. The value SHOULD normally not be Null [1] and Numbers SHOULD NOT contain fractional parts [2]

The Server MUST reply with the same value in the Response object if included. This member is used to correlate the context between the two objects.

[1] The use of Null as a value for the id member in a Request object is discouraged, because this specification uses a value of Null for Responses with an unknown id. Also, because JSON-RPC 1.0 uses an id value of Null for Notifications this could cause confusion in handling.

[2] Fractional parts may be problematic, since many decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions.
